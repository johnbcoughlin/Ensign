The **Ensign** software framework facilitates the efficient implementation of dynamical low-rank algorithms both on multi-core CPU and GPUs. It provides many primitives to make the implementation of such schemes easier and can work easily with both methods based on the projector splitting and the unconventional integrator. For more details on the dynamical low-rank method and in particular the problems implemented in the examples folder see
